Flappy Bird-Inspired Game in Unity
A simple yet addictive game developed in Unity, inspired by the classic Flappy Bird. This project uses the basics of game mechanics, collision detection, and scoring systems, built using Unity and C#.

About the Project
This game recreates the classic Flappy Bird gameplay experience, where players control a bird navigating through obstacles. This project was developed to gain experience with Unity and C# scripting, focusing on core game development concepts like physics and UI elements.

Features
Simple Controls: Tap the space bar to make the character flap its wings.
Obstacle Generation: Randomly generated pipes to increase replayability.
Scoring System: A real-time score tracker that increases as the player successfully navigates through the pipes.
Collision Detection: Accurate detection for game-over conditions when the bird collides with pipes.
Game Reset and Restart: Ability to restart the game after losing.

Technologies Used
Unity Game Engine: Used to develop and design the game environment.
C# Scripting: Implemented gameplay logic, collision detection, and scoring.
Physics Engine: Built-in Unity physics for realistic movement and collision responses.

Gameplay
To play, simply press the Spacebar (or tap on mobile) to make the bird flap its wings. The objective is to navigate through the gaps between pipes without hitting them or the ground. Each successful pass increases the score. Game over occurs upon collision, and you can restart to try for a higher score!


Future Improvements
Detect game-over conditions when the character collides with the ground or top of the screen
Adding sound effects and background music.
Implementing difficulty levels.
Adding a main menu.
